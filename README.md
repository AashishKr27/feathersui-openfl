# Feathers UI for OpenFL and Haxe

[Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/) is a cross-platform framework of user interface components for creative frontend projects. It is especially well-suited for games, interactive data visualizations, and other rich, multimedia experiences. With Feathers UI, you can create native apps for a wide range of devices and platforms â€” including phones, tablets, desktop computers, game consolesâ€¦ and you can even deploy to web browsers.

Built using the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) programming language and [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/). Like Feathers UI, both Haxe and OpenFL are open source, and they may be used for free in commercial projects.

## Get started

For more detailed instructions, see [Learn: Install Feathers UI for Haxe and OpenFL](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/installation/).

### Prerequisites

Requires Haxe **4.0.0-rc.3** or newer. Find it on the [Haxe Downloads List](https://haxe.org/download/list/).

### Installation

Open a terminal, and then install Feathers UI using the following command:

```sh
haxelib git feathersui https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/feathersui-openfl.git
```

This will also automatically install any additional required dependencies, like [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/), if necessary.

> The **haxelib git** command installs Feathers UI from [the Github repository](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/feathersui-openfl). In the future, when the library is more stable, official builds will be published to [Haxelib](http://lib.haxe.org/).

### Choose an editor or IDE

The following tutorials explain how to create Feathers UI projects in popular development environments:

- [HaxeDevelop](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/haxedevelop)

- [Visual Studio Code](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/haxedevelop)

Haxe is supported by [more editors and IDEs](https://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/editors-and-ides.html), and it may be possible to configure them to use Feathers UI too.
